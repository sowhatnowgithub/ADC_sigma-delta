This is project done by the Sparkonics Club of IIT Patna.

In Process of Making a Home Automation Project, We are building a Smart-Plug

For that we needed to operate a Voltage sensor, which converts Voltage into Bits of data, in that process we came across Sigma-Delta ADC

This ADC is relatively old, yet powerful, hence We started designing one part of this sigma-Delta ADC, that is sigma-delta modulator

This is a sigma Delta Modulator, which takes a input signal ( here we took sine wave) and converts into PCM (Pulse coded Modulation) resulting in much less quantistion noise

We have designed this to the best of our knowledge and tools at our disposal and after a large number of iterations, with support from friends and seniors.

We have done a small part of a ADC.

We have given a range for the succesful operation of ADC, to prevent aliasing and gave relation to OSR(Oversampling ratio) and input frequency and clock frequency in ADC_implementaion part, We have not derived the formula, we found values that worked with the simulation result, based off of the formula.

Do contribute to any changes and improvements, we are always looking for imporvement

If any mistakes do contirbute,

I believe this is about time we largely use github, for electronic reasearch also (compared to other "well known" fields).
